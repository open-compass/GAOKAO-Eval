        "\n",
        "11. **A. passed**\n",

        "Heatherwick Studio recently built a greenhouse at the edge of the National Trust's Woolbeding Gardens. This beautiful structure, named Glasshouse, is at the centre of a new garden that shows how the Silk Road influences English gardens even in modern times. The latest engineer techniques are applied to create this protective function structure that is also beautiful. The design features ten steel \"sepals\" made of glass and aluminium. These sepals open on warm days to give the inside plants sunshine and fresh air. In cold weather, the structure stays close to protect the plants. Further, the Silk Road Garden around the greenhouse walks visitors through a journey influenced by the ancient Silk Road, by which silk as well as many plant species came to Britain for the first time. These plants included modern Western favourites such as rosemary, lavender, and fennel. The garden also contains a winding path that guides visitors through the twelve regions of the Silk Road. The path offers over 300 plant species for visitors to see, too. The Glasshouse stands as a great achievement in contemporary design, to house the plants of the southwestern part of China at the end of a path retracing the steps along the Silk Route that brought the plants from their native habitat in Asia to come to define much of the richness of gardening in England.\n",

        "I ran back to Gunter and told him the bad news. He looked at me with a mix of concern and confusion. \"What do we do now?\" I asked, feeling a wave of panic wash over me. Gunter, however, was unfazed. \"Don't worry,\" he said, \"I have an idea.\" He quickly grabbed his phone and dialed another friend. After a brief conversation, he hung up and turned to me. \"My friend works at the bank,\" he explained. \"He'll help us out.\" With renewed hope, we made our way to the bank, where Gunter's friend was waiting. Within minutes, we had the money we needed, and we were on our way to the bus. As we boarded, Gunter turned to me and said, \"You know, sometimes it's not about the money, but about the people you meet along the way.\" I smiled, grateful for his kindness and the unexpected turn of events.\n",
        "\n",
        "Four days later, when I was back in Vienna, I called Gunter as promised. He answered on the first ring, his voice filled with excitement. \"I'm so glad you called,\" he said. \"I was wondering when you'd get back.\" I laughed and told him about my adventure in Prague. Gunter listened intently, chuckling at the funny parts. \"You know,\" he said when I finished, \"that was one of the best days of my life.\" I was surprised by his words, but I realized that he had genuinely cared about my situation. \"I'm glad I could help,\" he added. \"And I'm glad we met.\" We chatted for a while longer, sharing stories and laughter. When we finally hung up, I felt a sense of warmth and gratitude. Gunter had become more than just a stranger; he was a friend.\n"

            "Heatherwick Studio recently built a greenhouse at the edge of the National Trust's Woolbeding Gardens. This beautiful structure, named Glasshouse, is at the centre of a new garden that shows how the Silk Road influences English gardens even in modern times. The latest engineer techniques are applied to create this protective function structure that is also beautiful. The design features ten steel \"sepals\" made of glass and aluminium. These sepals open on warm days to give the inside plants sunshine and fresh air. In cold weather, the structure stays close to protect the plants. Further, the Silk Road Garden around the greenhouse walks visitors through a journey influenced by the ancient Silk Road, by which silk as well as many plant species came to Britain for the first time. These plants included modern Western favourites such as rosemary, lavender, and fennel. The garden also contains a winding path that guides visitors through the twelve regions of the Silk Road. The path offers over 300 plant species for visitors to see, too. The Glasshouse stands as a great achievement in contemporary design, to house the plants of the southwestern part of China at the end of a path retracing the steps along the Silk Route that brought the plants from their native habitat in Asia to come to define much of the richness of gardening in England.\n",

            "I ran back to Gunter and told him the bad news. He looked at me with a mix of concern and confusion. \"What do we do now?\" I asked, feeling a wave of panic wash over me. Gunter, however, was unfazed. \"Don't worry,\" he said, \"I have an idea.\" He quickly grabbed his phone and dialed another friend. After a brief conversation, he hung up and turned to me. \"My friend works at the bank,\" he explained. \"He'll help us out.\" With renewed hope, we made our way to the bank, where Gunter's friend was waiting. Within minutes, we had the money we needed, and we were on our way to the bus. As we boarded, Gunter turned to me and said, \"You know, sometimes it's not about the money, but about the people you meet along the way.\" I smiled, grateful for his kindness and the unexpected turn of events.\n",

He answered on the first ring, his voice filled with excitement. \"I'm so glad you called,\" he said. \"I was wondering when you'd get back.\" I laughed and told him about my adventure in Prague. Gunter listened intently, chuckling at the funny parts. \"You know,\" he said when I finished, \"that was one of the best days of my life.\" I was surprised by his words, but I realized that he had genuinely cared about my situation. \"I'm glad I could help,\" he added. \"And I'm glad we met.\" We chatted for a while longer, sharing stories and laughter. When we finally hung up, I felt a sense of warmth and gratitude. Gunter had become more than just a stranger; he was a friend.\n"
