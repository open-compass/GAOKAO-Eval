        "2. **C. But I still don't want to replace them.**\n",

        "\n",
        "5. **D. But a dictionary can be a pleasure to read.**\n",
        "   - This sentence concludes with the idea that reading a dictionary can be enjoyable, fitting well with the mention of Samuel Johnson's work.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, the completed passage would be:\n",
        "\n",
        "Not all great writers are great spellers. If you want to be published, it's vital to submit a perfect, professionally presented manuscript. **F. That means good grammar and no spelling mistakes.** No editor is likely to tolerate a writer who does not take the trouble to spell words correctly. I keep two reference books close-by on my desk: dictionary and thesaurus. I don't trust my laptop's spellchecker. **C. But I still don't want to replace them.** Of course, these days there are plenty of online dictionaries and thesauruses, but I'm old-fashioned enough to prefer a hard cover and pages I can leaf through with my fingers. I use the Concise Oxford Dictionary and the Collins Thesaurus. **E. Of course, a dictionary is not only for spelling.** It should give you a precise definition of each word, thus differentiating it from other words whose meanings are similar, but not identical. It will also usually show how the word is pronounced. In addition, I have an old two-volume copy of the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, picked up a few years ago in a bookshop sale for just 99 pence. Of course, with its 2,672 pages, it's not exactly short. It contains around 163,000 words, plus word combinations and idiomatic phrases. **A. I don't often use this dictionary.** However, if I need to check the origin of a word or to look up examples of its usage, there's nothing better. For well over a hundred years the most influential English dictionary was Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language published in 1755. \"To make dictionaries is dull work,\" wrote Johnson, illustrating one definition of \"dull\". **D. But a dictionary can be a pleasure to read.** A few minutes spent casting your eye over a page or two can be a rewarding experience.\n",

        "I've been motivated- and demotivated–by other folks' achievements all my life. When I was a teenager, a neighborhood friend **won** a marathon race. Feeling motivated, I started running **regularly**, but then two things happened. First, a girl I met one day told me she was **training** for a \"super,\" referring to a 52.4-mile double marathon. Then, the next day I went on my longest run - 15 miles. To be honest, I **hated** it! Between the girl making my **achievement** seem small and the pure boredom of jogging, I decided that the only **reason** I'd ever run again is if a big dog was running after me! So I **turned to** cycling. I got a good bike and rode a lot. I **dreamed** of entering cycle races until I flew to San Diego to visit my sister. While she was at work one day, I **borrowed** her bike and went for a ride. The **problem**: The roads there went through large valleys where I'd be riding uphill for miles at a time. I'd never faced such **challenges**. That day, I got **stopped** by about 100 \"local\" bikers who were used to such roads. When I got back home, suddenly riding my bike didn't seem quite as **appealing**. I've **matured** a lot since then. I've come to accept that whatever **goals** I set for myself, they just have to be my own.\n",

        "Heatherwick Studio recently built a greenhouse at the edge of the National Trust's Woolbeding Gardens. This beautiful structure, named Glasshouse, is at the centre of a new garden that shows how the Silk Road influences English gardens even in modern times. The latest engineering techniques are applied to create this protective functional structure that is also beautiful. The design features ten steel \"sepals （萼片）\" made of glass and aluminium （铝）. These sepals open on warm days to give the inside plants sunshine and fresh air. In cold weather, the structure stays closed to protect the plants. Further, the Silk Road Garden around the greenhouse walks visitors through a journey influenced by the ancient Silk Road, by which silk as well as many plant species came to Britain for the first time. These plants included modern Western favorites such as rosemary, lavender and fennel. The garden also contains a winding path that guides visitors through the twelve regions of the Silk Road. The path offers over 300 plant species for visitors to see, too. The Glasshouse stands as a great achievement in contemporary design, to house the plants of the southwestern part of China at the end of a path retracing （追溯）the steps along the Silk Route that brought the plants from their native habitat in Asia to come to define much of the richness of gardening in England.\n",

        "I ran back to Gunter and told him the bad news. He looked at me for a moment, then shrugged and said, \"No problem. You can pay me later.\" I was taken aback by his trust and kindness. He handed me a piece of paper with his phone number and address scribbled on it. \"Just give me a call when you get back to Vienna,\" he said with a reassuring smile. I thanked him profusely, grabbed my bags, and dashed towards the bus, which was now almost ready to leave. As I settled into my seat, I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of gratitude for Gunter's generosity. \n",
        "\n",
        "Four days later, when I was back in Vienna, I called Gunter as promised. He answered on the first ring, and I could hear the warmth in his voice. We arranged to meet at a café near the airport. When I arrived, Gunter was already there, sipping a cup of coffee. I handed him the money I owed, along with a small box of chocolates I had bought in Prague as a token of my appreciation. He accepted the money but waved off the chocolates, saying, \"Your gratitude is enough.\" We spent the next hour chatting about our lives, and I learned that Gunter had been a taxi driver for over 20 years. As we parted ways, I realized that sometimes, in the most unexpected moments, you meet people who restore your faith in humanity. Gunter was one of those people, and I knew I would never forget him.\n"

That means good grammar and no spelling mistakes.** No editor is likely to tolerate a writer who does not take the trouble to spell words correctly. I keep two reference books close-by on my desk: dictionary and thesaurus. I don't trust my laptop's spellchecker. **C. But I still don't want to replace them.** Of course, these days there are plenty of online dictionaries and thesauruses, but I'm old-fashioned enough to prefer a hard cover and pages I can leaf through with my fingers. I use the Concise Oxford Dictionary and the Collins Thesaurus. **E. Of course, a dictionary is not only for spelling.** It should give you a precise definition of each word, thus differentiating it from other words whose meanings are similar, but not identical. It will also usually show how the word is pronounced. In addition, I have an old two-volume copy of the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, picked up a few years ago in a bookshop sale for just 99 pence. Of course, with its 2,672 pages, it's not exactly short. It contains around 163,000 words, plus word combinations and idiomatic phrases. **A. I don't often use this dictionary.** However, if I need to check the origin of a word or to look up examples of its usage, there's nothing better. For well over a hundred years the most influential English dictionary was Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language published in 1755. \"To make dictionaries is dull work,\" wrote Johnson, illustrating one definition of \"dull\". **D. But a dictionary can be a pleasure to read.** A few minutes spent casting your eye over a page or two can be a rewarding experience.\n",

While she was at work one day, I **borrowed** her bike and went for a ride. The **problem**: The roads there went through large valleys where I'd be riding uphill for miles at a time. I'd never faced such **challenges**. That day, I got **stopped** by about 100 \"local\" bikers who were used to such roads. When I got back home, suddenly riding my bike didn't seem quite as **appealing**. I've **matured** a lot since then.

            "Heatherwick Studio recently built a greenhouse at the edge of the National Trust's Woolbeding Gardens. This beautiful structure, named Glasshouse, is at the centre of a new garden that shows how the Silk Road influences English gardens even in modern times. The latest engineering techniques are applied to create this protective functional structure that is also beautiful. The design features ten steel \"sepals （萼片）\" made of glass and aluminium （铝）. These sepals open on warm days to give the inside plants sunshine and fresh air. In cold weather, the structure stays closed to protect the plants. Further, the Silk Road Garden around the greenhouse walks visitors through a journey influenced by the ancient Silk Road, by which silk as well as many plant species came to Britain for the first time. These plants included modern Western favorites such as rosemary, lavender and fennel. The garden also contains a winding path that guides visitors through the twelve regions of the Silk Road. The path offers over 300 plant species for visitors to see, too. The Glasshouse stands as a great achievement in contemporary design, to house the plants of the southwestern part of China at the end of a path retracing （追溯）the steps along the Silk Route that brought the plants from their native habitat in Asia to come to define much of the richness of gardening in England.\n",

He handed me a piece of paper with his phone number and address scribbled on it. \"Just give me a call when you get back to Vienna,\" he said with a reassuring smile.

We arranged to meet at a café near the airport. When I arrived, Gunter was already there, sipping a cup of coffee. I handed him the money I owed, along with a small box of chocolates I had bought in Prague as a token of my appreciation. He accepted the money but waved off the chocolates, saying, \"Your gratitude is enough.\" We spent the next hour chatting about our lives, and I learned that Gunter had been a taxi driver for over 20 years. As we parted ways, I realized that sometimes, in the most unexpected moments, you meet people who restore your faith in humanity.
