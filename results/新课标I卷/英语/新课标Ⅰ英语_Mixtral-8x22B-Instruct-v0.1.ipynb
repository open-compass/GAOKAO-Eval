        "\"I am not crazy, \" says Dr. William Farber, shortly after performing acupuncture （针灸）on a rabbit. \"I am ahead of my time.\" If he seems a little defensive, it might be because even some of his coworkers occasionally laugh at his unusual methods. But Farber is certain he'll have the last laugh. He's one of a small but growing number of American veterinarians（兽医）now practicing \"holistic\" medicine-combining traditional Westem treatments with acupuncture, chiropractic（按摩疗法）and herbal medicine. Farber, a graduate of Colorado State University, started out as a more conventional veterinarian. He became interested in alternative treatments 20 years ago when he suffered from terrible back pain. He tried muscle-relaxing drugs but found little relief. Then he tried acupuncture, an ancient Chinese practice, and was amazed that he improved after two or three treatments. What worked on a veterinarian seemed likely to work on his patients. So, after studying the techniques for a couple of years, he began offering them to pets. Leigh Tindale's dog Charlie had a serious heart condition. After Charlie had a heart attack, Tindale says, she was prepared to put him to sleep, but Farber's treatments eased her dog's suffering so much that she was able to keep him alive for an additional five months. And Priscilla Dewing reports that her horse, Nappy, \"moves more easily and rides more comfortably\" after a chiropractic adjustment. Farber is certain that the holistic approach will grow more popular with time, and if the past is any indication, he may be right: Since 1982, membership in the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association has grown from 30 to over 700. \"Sometimes it surprises me that it works so well, \" he says. \"I will do anything to help an animal. That's my job.\"\n",
        "What do some of Farber's coworkers think of him? A. He's odd. B. He's strict. C. He's brave. D. He's rude.\n",
        "Why did Farber decide to try acupuncture on pets? A. He was trained in it at university. B. He was inspired by another veterinarian. C. He benefited from it as a patient. D. He wanted to save money for pet owners.\n",
        "What does paragraph 3 mainly talk about? A. Steps of a chiropractic treatment. B. The complexity of veterinarians' work. C. Examples of rare animal diseases. D. The effectiveness of holistic medicine.\n",
        "Why does the author mention the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association? A. To prove Farber's point. B. To emphasize its importance. C. To praise veterinarians. D. To advocate animal protection.\n",

        "Is comprehension the same whether a person reads a text onscreen or on paper? And are listening to and viewing content as effective as reading the written word when covering the same material? The answers to both questions are often \"no.\" The reasons relate to a variety of factors, including reduced concentration, an entertainment mindset （心态） and a tendency to multitask while consuming digital content. When reading texts of several hundred words or more, learning is generally more successful when it's on paper than onscreen. A large amount of research confirms this finding. The benefits of print reading particularly shine through when experimenters move from posing simple tasks-like identifying the main idea in a reading passage-to ones that require mental abstraction-such as drawing inferences from a text. The differences between print and digital reading results are partly related to paper's physical properties. With paper, there is a literal laying on of hands, along with the visual geography of distinct pages. People often link their memory of what they've read to how far into the book it was or where it was on the page. But equally important is the mental aspect. Reading researchers have proposed a theory called \"shallowing hypothesis （假说）.\" According to this theory, people approach digital texts with a mindset suited to social media, which are often not so serious, and devote less mental effort than when they are reading print. Audio （音频）and video can feel more engaging than text, and so university teachers increasingly turn to these technologies–say, assigning an online talk instead of an article by the same person. However, psychologists have demonstrated that when adults read news stories, they remember more of the content than if they listen to or view identical pieces. Digital texts, audio and video all have educational roles, especially when providing resources not available in print. However, for maximizing learning where mental focus and reflection are called for, educators shouldn't assume all media are the same, even when they contain identical words.\n",
        "What does the underlined phrase \"shine through\" in paragraph 2 mean? A. Seem unlikely to last. B. Seem hard to explain. C. Become ready to use. D. Become easy to notice.\n",
        "What does the shallowing hypothesis assume? A. Readers treat digital texts lightly. B. Digital texts are simpler to understand. C. People select digital texts randomly. D. Digital texts are suitable for social media.\n",
        "Why are audio and video increasingly used by university teachers? A. They can hold students' attention. B. They are more convenient to prepare. C. They help develop advanced skills. D. They are more informative than text.\n",
        "What does the author imply in the last paragraph? A. Students should apply multiple learning techniques. B. Teachers should produce their own teaching material. C. Print texts cannot be entirely replaced in education. D. Education outside the classroom cannot be ignored.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " The underlined phrase \"shine through\" in paragraph 2 means \"become easy to notice\" or \"become apparent.\" So, the correct answer is D.\n",
        "\n",

        "In the race to document the species on Earth before they go extinct, researchers and citizen scientists have collected billions of records. Today, most records of biodiversity are often in the form of photos, videos, and other digital records. Though they are useful for detecting shifts in the number and variety of species in an area, a new Stanford study has found that this type of record is not perfect. \"With the rise of technology it is easy for people to make observations of different species with the aid of a mobile application, \" said Barnabas Daru, who is lead author of the study and assistant professor of biology in the Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences. \"These observations now outnumber the primary data that comes from physical specimens（标本）, and since we are increasingly using observational data to investigate how species are responding to global change, I wanted to know: Are they usable? \" Using a global dataset of 1.9 billion records of plants, insects, birds, and animals, Daru and his team tested how well these data represent actual global biodiversity patterns. \"We were particularly interested in exploring the aspects of sampling that tend to bias（使有偏差）data, like the greater likelihood of a citizen scientist to take a picture of a flowering plant instead of the grass right next to it, \" said Daru. Their study revealed that the large number of observation-only records did not lead to better global coverage. Moreover, these data are biased and favor certain regions, time periods, and species. This makes sense because the people who get observational biodiversity data on mobile devices are often citizen scientists recording their encounters with species in areas nearby. These data are also biased toward certain species with attractive or eye-catching features. What can we do with the imperfect datasets of biodiversity? \"Quite a lot, \" Daru explained, \"Biodiversity apps can use our study results to inform users of oversampled areas and lead them to places–and even species– that are not well-sampled. To improve the quality of observational data, biodiversity apps can also encourage users to have an expert confirm the identification of their uploaded image.\"32.\n",
        "What do we know about the records of species collected now? A. They are becoming outdated. B. They are mostly in electronic form. C. They are limited in number. D. They are used for public exhibition.\n",
        "What does Daru's study focus on? A. Threatened species. B. Physical specimens. C. Observational data. D. Mobile applications.\n",
        "What has led to the biases according to the study? A. Mistakes in data analysis. B. Poor quality of uploaded pictures. C. Improper way of sampling. D. Unreliable data collection devices.\n",
        "What is Daru's suggestion for biodiversity apps? A. Review data from certain areas. B. Hire experts to check the records. C. Confim the identity of the users. D. Give guidance to citizen scientist.\n",

        "32. The passage states that \"most records of biodiversity are often in the form of photos, videos, and other digital records.\" Therefore, the correct answer is B. They are mostly in electronic form.\n",
        "\n",
        "33. The passage states that \"Daru and his team tested how well these data [observational data] represent actual global biodiversity patterns.\" Therefore, the correct answer is C. Observational data.\n",
        "\n",
        "34. The passage states that \"these data are biased and favor certain regions, time periods, and species... These data are also biased toward certain species with attractive or eye-catching features.\" This suggests that the biases are due to the improper way of sampling, as certain species are more likely to be observed and recorded than others. Therefore, the correct answer is C. Improper way of sampling.\n",
        "\n",
        "35. The passage states that \"Biodiversity apps can use our study results to inform users of oversampled areas and lead them to places–and even species– that are not well-sampled. To improve the quality of observational data, biodiversity apps can also encourage users to have an expert confirm the identification of their uploaded image.\" This suggests that Daru's suggestion for biodiversity apps is to give guidance to citizen scientists, encouraging them to observe and record species in underrepresented areas and to have their observations confirmed by experts. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Give guidance to citizen scientists.\n",

        "Not all great writers are great spellers. If you want to be published, it's vital to submit a perfect, professionally presented manuscript （原稿）. $\\underline{ 1 }$ No editor is likely to tolerate a writer who does not take the trouble to spell words correctly. I keep two reference books close-by on my desk: dictionary and thesaurus （同义词词典）. I don't trust my laptop's spellchecker. $\\underline{ 2 }$ Of course, these days there are plenty of online dictionaries and thesauruses, but I'm old-fashioned enough to prefer a hard cover and pages I can leaf through with my fingers. I use the Concise Oxford Dictionary and the Collins Thesaurus. $\\underline{ 3 }$ It should give you a precise definition of each word, thus differentiating it from other words whose meanings are similar, but not identical. It will also usually show how the word is pronounced. In addition, I have an old two-volume copy of the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, picked up a few years ago in a bookshop sale for just 99 pence. Of course, with its 2, 672 pages, it's not exactly short. It contains around 163, 000 words, plus word combinations and idiomatic phrases. $\\underline{ 4 }$ However, if I need to check the origin of a word or to look up examples of its usage, there's nothing better. For well over a hundred years the most influential English dictionary was Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language published in 1755. \"To make dictionaries is dull （乏味）work, \"wrote Johnson, illustrating one definition of \"dull'. $\\underline{ 5 }$ A few minutes spent casting your eye over a page or two can be a rewarding experience.\n",
        "A. I don't often use this dictionary.\n",
        "B. It takes no account of the context.\n",
        "C. But I still don't want to replace them.\n",
        "D. But a dictionary can be a pleasure to read.\n",
        "E. Of course, a dictionary is not only for spelling.\n",

        " The correct answers are:\n",

        "1. F. \"That means good grammar and no spelling mistakes.\" This sentence is the most appropriate to fill the blank as it directly relates to the importance of correct spelling and grammar in a manuscript.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. C. \"But I still don't want to replace them.\" This sentence fits the context as it explains the author's preference for physical dictionaries over online ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. E. \"Of course, a dictionary is not only for spelling.\" This sentence is suitable as it introduces the additional benefits of using a dictionary, such as understanding precise definitions and pronunciations.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. D. \"But a dictionary can be a pleasure to read.\" This sentence is fitting as it highlights the author's enjoyment in reading dictionaries, particularly for understanding word origins and usage examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. A. \"I don't often use this dictionary.\" This sentence is not the best fit for the context. The author does not mention using the dictionary infrequently. Instead, the sentence \"Dictionaries don't always give you enough information\" would be more appropriate to express the idea that dictionaries may not provide all the necessary context or examples. However, since \"Dictionaries don't always give you enough information\" is not an option, the most suitable answer is \"A. I don't often use this dictionary.\"\n",

Further, the Silk Roue Garden around the greenhouse $\\text{leads}$ visitors through a journey influenced by the ancient Silk Road, by which silk as well as many plant species came to Britain for $\\text{the}$ first time. These plants included modern Western $\\text{favourites}$ such as rosemary, lavender and fennel. The garden also contains a winding path that guides visitors through the twelve regions of the Silk Road. The path offers over 300 plant species for visitors to see, too. The Glasshouse stands $\\text{as}$ a great achievement in contemporary design, to house the plants of the southwestern part of China at the end of a path retracing the steps along the Silk Route $\\text{that}$ brought the plants from their native habitat in Asia to come to define much of the $\\text{richness}$ of gardening in England.\n",

        "阅读下面材料，根据其内容和所给段落开头语续写两段，使之构成一篇完整的短文。 I met Gunter on a cold, wet and unforgeable evening in September. I had planned to fly to Vienna and take a bus to Prague for a conference. Due to a big storm, my flight had been delayed by an hour and a half. I touched down in Vienna just 30 minutes before the departure of the last bus to Prague. The moment I got off the plane, I ran like crazy through the airport building and jumped into the first taxi on the rank without a second thought. That was when I met Gunter. I told him where I was going, but he said he hadn't heard of the bus station. I thought my pronunciation was the problem, so l explained again more slowly, but he still looked confused. When I was about to give up, Gunter fished out his little phone and rang up a friend. After a heated discussion that lasted for what seemed like a century, Gunter put his phone down and started the car. Finally, with just two minutes to spare we rolled into the bus station. Thankfully, there was a long queue （队列）still waiting to board the bus. Gunter parked the taxi behind the bus, turned around, and looked at me with a big smile on his face. \"We made it, \" he said. Just then I realised that I had zero cash in my wallet. I flashed him an apologetic smile as I pulled out my Portuguese bank card. He tried it several times, but the card machine just did not play along. A feeling of helplessness washed over me as I saw the bus queue thinning out. At this moment, Gunter pointed towards the waiting hall of the bus station. There, at the entrance, was a cash machine. I jumped out of the car, made a mad run for the machine, and popped my card in, only to read the message: \"Out of order. Sorry.\" 注意： （1）续写词数应为150个左右； （2）请按如下格式在答题纸的相应位置作答。 I ran back to Gunter and told him the bad news. __ Four days later, when I was back in Vienna, I called Gunter as promised. __\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " I ran back to Gunter and told him the bad news. He looked at me with a mixture of surprise and concern. I apologized profusely, feeling utterly embarrassed and helpless. Gunter, however, remained calm and composed. He reassured me that it was not a big deal and that we would figure something out. He suggested that I could pay him the next time I was in Vienna. I was taken aback by his trust and generosity. I promised him that I would pay him back as soon as possible and thanked him for his understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "Four days later, when I was back in Vienna, I called Gunter as promised. I was relieved to hear his cheerful voice on the other end of the line. I told him that I had returned to Vienna and asked him if we could meet so that I could pay him back. He agreed and suggested a time and place. We met at a small café near the bus station. I handed him the money, and he accepted it graciously. We spent the next hour chatting and getting to know each other. I learned that Gunter was a retired engineer who had worked for a large company in Vienna. He had two grown children and three grandchildren. He was a kind and gentle man who loved to travel and meet new people. I was grateful to have met him and thanked him again for his help. We promised to keep in touch and said our goodbyes. As I walked away, I felt a sense of gratitude and warmth. I knew that I had made a new friend in Gunter, and I looked forward to our next meeting.\n"

            "Mistral 8*22B 模型输出：\"I am not crazy, \" says Dr. William Farber, shortly after performing acupuncture （针灸）on a rabbit. \"I am ahead of my time.\" If he seems a little defensive, it might be because even some of his coworkers occasionally laugh at his unusual methods. But Farber is certain he'll have the last laugh. He's one of a small but growing number of American veterinarians（兽医）now practicing \"holistic\" medicine-combining traditional Westem treatments with acupuncture, chiropractic（按摩疗法）and herbal medicine. Farber, a graduate of Colorado State University, started out as a more conventional veterinarian. He became interested in alternative treatments 20 years ago when he suffered from terrible back pain. He tried muscle-relaxing drugs but found little relief. Then he tried acupuncture, an ancient Chinese practice, and was amazed that he improved after two or three treatments. What worked on a veterinarian seemed likely to work on his patients. So, after studying the techniques for a couple of years, he began offering them to pets. Leigh Tindale's dog Charlie had a serious heart condition. After Charlie had a heart attack, Tindale says, she was prepared to put him to sleep, but Farber's treatments eased her dog's suffering so much that she was able to keep him alive for an additional five months. And Priscilla Dewing reports that her horse, Nappy, \"moves more easily and rides more comfortably\" after a chiropractic adjustment. Farber is certain that the holistic approach will grow more popular with time, and if the past is any indication, he may be right: Since 1982, membership in the American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association has grown from 30 to over 700. \"Sometimes it surprises me that it works so well, \" he says. \"I will do anything to help an animal. That's my job.\"\n",
            "What do some of Farber's coworkers think of him? A. He's odd. B. He's strict. C. He's brave. D. He's rude.\n",
            "Why did Farber decide to try acupuncture on pets? A. He was trained in it at university. B. He was inspired by another veterinarian. C. He benefited from it as a patient. D. He wanted to save money for pet owners.\n",

            "Mistral 8*22B 模型输出：Is comprehension the same whether a person reads a text onscreen or on paper? And are listening to and viewing content as effective as reading the written word when covering the same material? The answers to both questions are often \"no.\" The reasons relate to a variety of factors, including reduced concentration, an entertainment mindset （心态） and a tendency to multitask while consuming digital content. When reading texts of several hundred words or more, learning is generally more successful when it's on paper than onscreen. A large amount of research confirms this finding. The benefits of print reading particularly shine through when experimenters move from posing simple tasks-like identifying the main idea in a reading passage-to ones that require mental abstraction-such as drawing inferences from a text. The differences between print and digital reading results are partly related to paper's physical properties. With paper, there is a literal laying on of hands, along with the visual geography of distinct pages. People often link their memory of what they've read to how far into the book it was or where it was on the page. But equally important is the mental aspect. Reading researchers have proposed a theory called \"shallowing hypothesis （假说）.\" According to this theory, people approach digital texts with a mindset suited to social media, which are often not so serious, and devote less mental effort than when they are reading print. Audio （音频）and video can feel more engaging than text, and so university teachers increasingly turn to these technologies–say, assigning an online talk instead of an article by the same person. However, psychologists have demonstrated that when adults read news stories, they remember more of the content than if they listen to or view identical pieces. Digital texts, audio and video all have educational roles, especially when providing resources not available in print. However, for maximizing learning where mental focus and reflection are called for, educators shouldn't assume all media are the same, even when they contain identical words.\n",

            "Mistral 8*22B 模型输出：In the race to document the species on Earth before they go extinct, researchers and citizen scientists have collected billions of records. Today, most records of biodiversity are often in the form of photos, videos, and other digital records. Though they are useful for detecting shifts in the number and variety of species in an area, a new Stanford study has found that this type of record is not perfect. \"With the rise of technology it is easy for people to make observations of different species with the aid of a mobile application, \" said Barnabas Daru, who is lead author of the study and assistant professor of biology in the Stanford School of Humanities and Sciences. \"These observations now outnumber the primary data that comes from physical specimens（标本）, and since we are increasingly using observational data to investigate how species are responding to global change, I wanted to know: Are they usable? \" Using a global dataset of 1.9 billion records of plants, insects, birds, and animals, Daru and his team tested how well these data represent actual global biodiversity patterns. \"We were particularly interested in exploring the aspects of sampling that tend to bias（使有偏差）data, like the greater likelihood of a citizen scientist to take a picture of a flowering plant instead of the grass right next to it, \" said Daru. Their study revealed that the large number of observation-only records did not lead to better global coverage. Moreover, these data are biased and favor certain regions, time periods, and species. This makes sense because the people who get observational biodiversity data on mobile devices are often citizen scientists recording their encounters with species in areas nearby. These data are also biased toward certain species with attractive or eye-catching features. What can we do with the imperfect datasets of biodiversity? \"Quite a lot, \" Daru explained, \"Biodiversity apps can use our study results to inform users of oversampled areas and lead them to places–and even species– that are not well-sampled. To improve the quality of observational data, biodiversity apps can also encourage users to have an expert confirm the identification of their uploaded image.\"32.\n",

            "Mistral 8*22B 模型输出：Not all great writers are great spellers. If you want to be published, it's vital to submit a perfect, professionally presented manuscript （原稿）. $\\underline{ 1 }$ No editor is likely to tolerate a writer who does not take the trouble to spell words correctly. I keep two reference books close-by on my desk: dictionary and thesaurus （同义词词典）. I don't trust my laptop's spellchecker. $\\underline{ 2 }$ Of course, these days there are plenty of online dictionaries and thesauruses, but I'm old-fashioned enough to prefer a hard cover and pages I can leaf through with my fingers. I use the Concise Oxford Dictionary and the Collins Thesaurus. $\\underline{ 3 }$ It should give you a precise definition of each word, thus differentiating it from other words whose meanings are similar, but not identical. It will also usually show how the word is pronounced. In addition, I have an old two-volume copy of the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, picked up a few years ago in a bookshop sale for just 99 pence. Of course, with its 2, 672 pages, it's not exactly short. It contains around 163, 000 words, plus word combinations and idiomatic phrases. $\\underline{ 4 }$ However, if I need to check the origin of a word or to look up examples of its usage, there's nothing better. For well over a hundred years the most influential English dictionary was Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language published in 1755. \"To make dictionaries is dull （乏味）work, \"wrote Johnson, illustrating one definition of \"dull'. $\\underline{ 5 }$ A few minutes spent casting your eye over a page or two can be a rewarding experience.\n",

            "2. C. \"But I still don't want to replace them.\" This sentence fits the context as it explains the author's preference for physical dictionaries over online ones.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. E. \"Of course, a dictionary is not only for spelling.\" This sentence is suitable as it introduces the additional benefits of using a dictionary, such as understanding precise definitions and pronunciations.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. D. \"But a dictionary can be a pleasure to read.\" This sentence is fitting as it highlights the author's enjoyment in reading dictionaries, particularly for understanding word origins and usage examples.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. A. \"I don't often use this dictionary.\" This sentence is not the best fit for the context. The author does not mention using the dictionary infrequently. Instead, the sentence \"Dictionaries don't always give you enough information\" would be more appropriate to express the idea that dictionaries may not provide all the necessary context or examples. However, since \"Dictionaries don't always give you enough information\" is not an option, the most suitable answer is \"A. I don't often use this dictionary.\"\n",

I had planned to fly to Vienna and take a bus to Prague for a conference. Due to a big storm, my flight had been delayed by an hour and a half. I touched down in Vienna just 30 minutes before the departure of the last bus to Prague. The moment I got off the plane, I ran like crazy through the airport building and jumped into the first taxi on the rank without a second thought. That was when I met Gunter. I told him where I was going, but he said he hadn't heard of the bus station. I thought my pronunciation was the problem, so l explained again more slowly, but he still looked confused. When I was about to give up, Gunter fished out his little phone and rang up a friend. After a heated discussion that lasted for what seemed like a century, Gunter put his phone down and started the car. Finally, with just two minutes to spare we rolled into the bus station. Thankfully, there was a long queue （队列）still waiting to board the bus. Gunter parked the taxi behind the bus, turned around, and looked at me with a big smile on his face. \"We made it, \" he said. Just then I realised that I had zero cash in my wallet. I flashed him an apologetic smile as I pulled out my Portuguese bank card. He tried it several times, but the card machine just did not play along. A feeling of helplessness washed over me as I saw the bus queue thinning out. At this moment, Gunter pointed towards the waiting hall of the bus station. There, at the entrance, was a cash machine. I jumped out of the car, made a mad run for the machine, and popped my card in, only to read the message: \"Out of order. Sorry.\" 注意： （1）续写词数应为150个左右； （2）请按如下格式在答题纸的相应位置作答。 I ran back to Gunter and told him the bad news. __ Four days later, when I was back in Vienna, I called Gunter as promised. __\n",

Gunter, however, remained calm and composed. He reassured me that it was not a big deal and that we would figure something out. He suggested that I could pay him the next time I was in Vienna. I was taken aback by his trust and generosity. I promised him that I would pay him back as soon as possible and thanked him for his understanding.\n",

            "Four days later, when I was back in Vienna, I called Gunter as promised. I was relieved to hear his cheerful voice on the other end of the line. I told him that I had returned to Vienna and asked him if we could meet so that I could pay him back. He agreed and suggested a time and place. We met at a small café near the bus station. I handed him the money, and he accepted it graciously. We spent the next hour chatting and getting to know each other. I learned that Gunter was a retired engineer who had worked for a large company in Vienna. He had two grown children and three grandchildren. He was a kind and gentle man who loved to travel and meet new people. I was grateful to have met him and thanked him again for his help. We promised to keep in touch and said our goodbyes. As I walked away, I felt a sense of gratitude and warmth. I knew that I had made a new friend in Gunter, and I looked forward to our next meeting.\n"
